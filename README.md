# UID2PNG

This script automates the process of generating PyMOL visualizations for a list of proteins using structure models from AlphaFold Database.

It performs the following tasks:
1. Reads a list of protein UIDs from a TSV/CSV file.
2. Downloads the corresponding AlphaFold models from https://alphafold.ebi.ac.uk/
3. Edits a PyMOL script template for each protein.
4. Runs PyMOL in headless mode to generate:
   - A PyMOL session file (`.pse`)
   - A snapshot image (`.png`)
